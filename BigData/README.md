# BigData, Machine Learning and text mining by example Using PySpark (Spark+Python).

1. [General introduction](general)
2. DataMining and Text mining
1. Why Spark for BigData, ML and text mining
2. Basic knowledge for Text Mining:
    * LSA,
    * DSA,
    * TF-IDF,
    * Word2Vec. 
3. installing pyspark on Windows or Linux and first basic exemples
4. More realistic use case

1,2,3 Will be available online (asynchronously) followed by an online gathering for caching and complementary needs.

4. Synchronous online session for lab



We will briefly present the fundamentals behind text mining then make a lab about the specific example installing and using standalone spark on Linux and/or Windows 10 with Python
