# BigData, Machine Learning and text mining by example Using PySpark (Spark+Python).

1. [DataMining and Text mining](general)
1. Why Spark for BigData, ML and text mining
3. Mastering Big Data Analytics with PySpark [Machine Learning & Data Mining Workshop]
4. Use cases and examples

Along with learning by examples we will cover "Basic knowledge for Text Mining" as:
    * LSA,
    * DSA,
    * TF-IDF,
    * Word2Vec. 

1,2,3 Will be available online (asynchronously) followed by an online gathering for caching and complementary needs.

4. Synchronous online session for lab



The fundamentals behind machine learning, data mining and text mining will be presented gradually by covering specific examples

* [Why Spark, basic concept](/Spark/)
* [From Functions to BigData MapReduce paradigm](/relatedConcepts/mapReduce.md)
* [Fundamentals for Text Mining](Fundamentals)
* [Lab spark python](Labs)
